# Library Return Lateness Project

This README documents the steps that are necessary to follow through the Library Return Lateness Project project. The project has a wrangler directory used for preprocessing, visualization, text preprocessing and building of pipelines. Steps like outlier detection, NaN handling, and data engineering are contained in the data_preprocessing.py python file. The library_late_return Workbook (a Jupyter Notebook) is where most of the code was executed and the outputs displayed. Lastly, the utils script located in wrangler has some useful modules to evaluate the supervised learning algorithm used as demonstrated in the notebook.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary: To demonstrate the step by step of putting together a solution for the library project.
* Presentation: A PDF file (Insighs and EDA) has been put together to present findings to the business stakeholders


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up: ensure you have python 3 up and running
* Configuration: ensure all modules are imported properly. They all depend on each other
* Dependencies: python 3, pandas, scikit-learn, sklearn pipelines, lightgbm, etc
* Other Dependencies: these can be found in the requirement.txt. You can pip install them
* Database configuration: no required configuration
* How to run tests: no tests files used yet. Version 2 will come with test cases
